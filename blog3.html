                    <p class="lead">The luxury apartment market is evolving beyond traditional definitions of opulence. In 2025, premium living means seamlessly integrated sustainability, wellness-focused design, and intelligent technology that enhances rather than complicates daily life. This comprehensive guide explores the design trends reshaping luxury residential spaces.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Trend 1: Biophilic Design & Natural Integration</h2>
                <p>Biophilic design—the integration of natural elements into built environments—has moved from trend to essential feature in luxury developments. This approach recognizes the human need for connection with nature and its positive impact on well-being, productivity, and overall quality of life.</p>

                <ul>
